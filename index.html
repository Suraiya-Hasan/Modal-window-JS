      My name is Suraiya Hasan, and I am currently a student at the Islamic
      University of Technology in Gazipur.
      I just completed my third year of BSc in software engineering,
      and I am incredibly passionate about web development. My goal is to become a
      frontend developer, as I find great joy in crafting visually appealing and
      user-friendly websites.

      Right now, I am fortunate enough to be pursuing an internship that allows me 
      to apply my knowledge and learn from experienced professionals in the 
      field. It's an exciting opportunity for me to gain practical 
      experience and further refine my skills.

      Aside from my academic and professional endeavors, 
      I have a special place in my heart for my two adorable cats.
      They bring so much happiness into my life, and I cherish every moment spent
       with them. In my leisure time, I enjoy
      immersing myself in the world of series, books, binge-watching my favorite shows,
       and exploring a wide range of delicious foods. I love taking photographs as well.

      One of my biggest dreams is to travel to every country in the world. 
      If not all, at least I hope to explore the enchanting beauty of Europe. 
      But what makes this dream even more special is my desire to take my 
      beloved mother along with me on this incredible journey. 
      I want to create priceless memories together and show her the wonders of
      the world.

      Above all, my ultimate motivation is to make my parents proud. Their unwavering support and encouragement have
      been the driving force behind my aspirations. With their blessings and my determination, I am confident that I can
      achieve my goals and make a positive impact in the field of web development.

      I am excited about the future and all the possibilities it holds. I will continue to work hard, learn, and grow as
      a frontend developer, with the hope of one day making a difference in the digital world and fulfilling my dreams
      of exploration.
